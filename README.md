# CHANTEOS PROTOCOL

> **"Order from Chaos. Music from Noise."**

## ⚡ MANIFESTO
Chanteos is not a text editor. It is a **Lyric Construction Environment**.
We reject the empty page anxiety. We embrace the block, the timestamp, and the grid.

- **Anti-Linear:** Songs are structures, not lines of text.
- **Sonic-First:** Words without rhythm are just poetry.
- **Local-Foundry:** Your data lives where you create it.

## 🛰️ MODULES

### 1. LYRIC ENGINE
**Status:** ✅ ONLINE
The core forge. Break your thoughts into atomic blocks. Tag them. Time them. Rearrange them until the truth emerges.

### 2. AUDIO VAULT
**Status:** ⚠️ VOLATILE
Direct injection of reference tracks. Playback control for precise lyric locking.
*Warning: Current audio state is session-bound.*

### 3. PROMPT INJECTION
**Status:** ✅ ONLINE
Algorithmic disruption. When the flow stops, inject constrained chaos to restart the engine.
